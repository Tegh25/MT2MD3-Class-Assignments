# MT2MD3-Class-Assignments

This repository preserves and displays all my class work and assignments from my second-year Data Structures and Algorithms course, all written in C++.

For the most part, only the solutions to questions marked as **programming** were uploaded to this repository. Therefore, assignment 3, assignment 6, and the final exam were not uploaded as they consisted entirely of **short answer** questions.

The topics covered in this course are as follows:
- Introduction to C++
- Object Oriented Programming with C++
- Linked Data Representations
- Recursion
- Algorithm Analysis
- Stacks, Queues, and Deques
- Lists and Iterators
- Trees
- Hash Tables
- Sorting
- Graphs

The assignments assisted in the understanding of and built upon these topics which were taught in lecture.

As I have passed this class, this repo will no longer be updated.
